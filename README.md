This project analyzes [dataset name] using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The primary objective is to explore the dataset, derive insights, and visualize relationships between different variables. The project covers the following tasks:

Data Loading and Cleaning: 
The dataset is loaded and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values and optimizing data formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Key statistics are computed, and several exploratory visualizations are created to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
Visualization:
Various plots (such as scatterplots, bar charts, etc.) are created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize relationships between key variables in the dataset.
Analysis and Interpretation: 
Based on the visualizations and statistical summaries, insights about the data are drawn, helping in making informed decisions or further analysis.
